### How do I use this?
#### Download:

    curl -LO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/finalduty/cis_benchmarks_audit/main/cis_audit.py && chmod 750 cis_audit.py

#### Run: 
```
#usage: cis_audit.py [-h] [--level {1,2}] [--include INCLUDES [INCLUDES ...]]
                    [--exclude EXCLUDES [EXCLUDES ...]]
                    [-l {DEBUG,INFO,WARNING,CRITICAL}] [--debug] [--nice]
                    [--no-nice] [--no-colour]
                    [--system-type {server,workstation}] [--server]
                    [--workstation] [--outformat {csv,json,psv,text,tsv}]
                    [--text] [--json] [--csv] [--psv] [--tsv] [-V] [-c CONFIG]

This script runs tests on the system to check for compliance against the CIS Benchmarks. No changes are made to system files by this script.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --level {1,2}         Run tests for the specified level only
  --include INCLUDES [INCLUDES ...]
                        Space delimited list of tests to include
  --exclude EXCLUDES [EXCLUDES ...]
                        Space delimited list of tests to exclude
  -l {DEBUG,INFO,WARNING,CRITICAL}, --log-level {DEBUG,INFO,WARNING,CRITICAL}
                        Set log output level
  --debug               Run script with debug output turned on. Equivalent to --log-level DEBUG
  --nice                Lower the CPU priority for test execution. This is the default behaviour.
  --no-nice             Do not lower CPU priority for test execution. This may make the tests complete faster but at the cost of putting a higher load on the server. Setting this overrides the --nice option.
  --no-colour, --no-color
                        Disable colouring for STDOUT. Output redirected to a file/pipe is never coloured.
  --system-type {server,workstation}
                        Set which test level to reference
  --server              Use "server" levels to determine which tests to run. Equivalent to --system-type server [Default]
  --workstation         Use "workstation" levels to determine which tests to run. Equivalent to --system-type workstation
  --outformat {csv,json,psv,text,tsv}
                        Output type for results
  --text                Output results as text. Equivalent to --output text [default]
  --json                Output results as json. Equivalent to --output json
  --csv                 Output results as comma-separated values. Equivalent to --output csv
  --psv                 Output results as pipe-separated values. Equivalent to --output psv
  --tsv                 Output results as tab-separated values. Equivalent to --output tsv
  -V, --version         Print version and exit
  -c CONFIG, --config CONFIG
                        Location of config file to load

Examples:
    
    Run with debug enabled:
    ./cis_audit.py --debug
        
    Exclude tests from section 1.1 and 1.3.2:
    ./cis_audit.py --exclude 1.1 1.3.2
        
    Include tests only from section 4.1 but exclude tests from section 4.1.1:
    ./cis_audit.py --include 4.1 --exclude 4.1.1
        
    Run only level 1 tests
    ./cis_audit.py --level 1
        
    Run level 1 tests and include some but not all SELinux questions
    ./cis_audit.py --level 1 --include 1.6 --exclude 1.6.1.2

```

### Disclaimer:
This is not a replacement for a full audit and a passing result from this script does not necessarily mean that you are compliant (but it should give you a good idea of where to start).  

The script will never make changes to your system.

This script can run multiple tests at a time and it is possible that some tests could have an adverse impact on your system(s). There is an adjustable limit for the number of concurrent tests as well as a nicing argument which can help keep load down.  

_No warranty is offered and no responsibility will be taken for damage to systems resulting from the use of this script._
